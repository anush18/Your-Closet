        <p class = "w3-large">We designed "Your Closet" to help individuals to choose outfits 
            from their closets effortlessly and in a fraction of time. 
            We understand that choosing an outfit can be time consuming and 
            quite messy. While designing "Your Closet" we took into consideration many of 
            these problems and came up with a solution. When using the website 
            you can view "Your Closet" from anywhere and avoid having to run through
            tons of clothings items. Here, you can put together outfits and view everything from tops, 
            bottoms, dresses, and shoes along with outfits that are already pieced together.</p>
